# nubank_ui_clone

This is a "classic" challenge in Brazil. This fintech is famous by using Flutter.

**IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS**
- this a clone, but not exact - I don't have access to the design system etc;
- I used what was possible: Material Icons and stuff;
- I am using Graphik font (non-commercial purpose);
- All icons could be different, mock purposes only;
- It does have a lots of code lines, I were not thinking the best solution, just to clone the UI;

**Features**
- A simple Splash Page;
- Values toggle visibility button (little eye icon button on top);
- Some componentization: only what I considered 100% necessary;
